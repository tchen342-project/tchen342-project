- 1. [SVM and K-Fold Cross-Validation](https://github.com/tchen342-project/ml-svm.git)
Implemented Support Vector Machines (SVM) for mnist-data and spam-ham datasets, evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation for training set accuracy.

- 2. [Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent](https://github.com/tchen342-project/ml_gradient_descent.git)
Implemented logistic regression using both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Explored the convergence behavior with varying learning rates and enhanced SGD with a diminishing step size strategy.

- 3. [Gaussian Classifier with LDA and QDA](https://github.com/tchen342-project/ml_Gaussian.git)
Utilized Gaussian classifier techniques for digits and spam datasets. Fit Gaussian distributions using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and modeled class conditional probabilities with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).

- 4. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/tchen342-project/ml_deep_learning.git)
MLP for FashionMNIST
Trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. Achieved over 82% validation accuracy after 8 epochs, visualized training and validation performance, and optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

CIFAR-10 CNN with AlexNet Architecture
Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using AlexNet architecture to classify CIFAR-10 images. Applied normalization, augmentation, and SGD for optimization, ensuring competitive accuracy with validation and performance monitoring.

- 5. [Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/tchen342-project/ml_decision_tree.git)
Developed decision trees and random forests from scratch for classification tasks including spam detection and Titanic survivor prediction. Managed categorical features, handled missing values, and evaluated model performance with accuracy metrics.
